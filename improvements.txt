First confusing feature that I myself encountered is the fact that the statements grammar is rather limited.
For example, this is not a valid statement: John is an orange duck. You have to make two statements for that.
This could be solved by improving the grammar for statements (I don't think this is a 'major improvement')
This wouldn't be hard to implement and basically only the statement parsing part would be a bit different.

Another thing is the "ambiguity" or all possible parse trees. I think probability as it was discussed
in the lectures (this could be extended to be a PCFG) could be applied when ambiguity
(two or more possible trees) is encountered. Then one of the ambiguous trees could be chosen
instead of just reporting that the sentence is ambiguous.
